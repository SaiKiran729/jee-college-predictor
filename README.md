# College-Predictor
"Machine Learning Based Prediction Model For College Admission"
The system looks at the academic merits, background, and criteria for college admission of the student. It then predicts whether or not a student will attend a university or college. For precise expectations, we have prepared an ML model to give results.
# Tools & technologies used:
Python,Scikit-learn,Flask,HTML and CSS
# Objectives
1.  help students pursuing engineering identify the best colleges they can get, based on their rank and category. Thus, students will not have to make extra efforts on research about different colleges they can take admission into. ï‚·
2.  To help students to fill their preferences at the time of option-entry process accurately.
3.  Ease the decision-making process for students as they would have a ready list of best colleges into which they are eligible to take admission. This would help them make better choices of college and branch before allotment.

Educational organizations have always played an important and vital role in society for development and growth of any individual. There are different college prediction apps and websites being maintained contemporarily, but using them is tedious to some extent, due to the lack of articulate information regarding colleges, and the time consumed in searching the best deserving college. The problem statement, hence being tackled, is to design a college prediction/prediction system and to provide a probabilistic insight into college administration for overall rating, cut-offs of the colleges, admission intake and preferences of students. Also, it helps students avoid spending time and money on counsellor and stressful research related to finding a suitable colleg
